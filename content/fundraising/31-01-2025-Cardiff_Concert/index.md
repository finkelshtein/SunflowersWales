An amazing fundraising concert <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/509119647453752?multi_permalinks=1193963312302712&hoisted_section_header_type=recently_seen" target="_blank">Singing Circle and friends</a> was organised in Cardiff by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/601579067497655/user/100019200306495/" target="_blank">Nichola Bojczuk</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/509119647453752/" target="_blank">Cardiff For Ukraine</a>.

Our <a href="../../dancing" target="_blank">Sunflowers dance group</a> was proud to take part in the event, and half of the funds raised were sent to Ukraine to support a school for children with additional needs in Chornomorsk (Odesa region). The main portion of the money, £400, was used to create a play and relaxation area in the school’s shelter. The children have to spend long hours there during devastating air alerts, and this space helps make that time more comfortable and engaging.

A huge thank you to everyone who contributed to this fundraiser! Together, we can make children's lives a little better.
If anyone would like to donate to further support this school, please send your contribution to our <a href="../../donate"  target="_blank">bank account</a> with the reference "safeplay".
