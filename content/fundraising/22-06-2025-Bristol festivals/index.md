It was a long, eventful, and wonderful day! New acquaintances, hugs, conversations, emotions!

We <a href="../../dancing" target="_blank">danced</a> and sang at two festivals — <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/601579067497655/user/100064573517372/" target="_blank">South Gloucestershire Armed Forces Day</a> and Yate Rocks.

Huge thanks to the organisers for the invitation and financial support!

Thank you to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/601579067497655/user/100021561261219/" target="_blank">Neil Keogh</a> for arranging the transport and for the excellent driving!

Thanks to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/galina.cuhno/" target="_blank">Halyna Chukhno</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/solomiya.tykha/" target="_blank">Solomiya Tykha</a> for the lovingly made sunflowers, which flew off in an instant!

This day brought us £960 — we’re preparing another shipment to Ukraine.

Together we are stronger!
