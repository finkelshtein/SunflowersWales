Recently, we received our first payment of Â£1282.24!!!

Today, we were welcomed at the Llandeilo Co-op shop. It was nice to speak with people about ourselves, our activities, Ukraine, and our traditions. 

Co-op customers also had the opportunity to take photos with Ukrainian wreaths and purchase Welsh daffodils with Ukrainian ribbons.

Many thanks to the Member Pioneer for Co-op Llandeilo, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/christophffischer" target="_blank">Christoph Fisher</a>! We are very grateful for your constant support!
