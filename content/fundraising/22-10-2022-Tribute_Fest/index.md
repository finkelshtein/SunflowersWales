The Diplomat Hotel in Llanelli welcomed an overwhelming tribute fest with ABBA, Tina Turner and Cher's greatest hits. Two 45 minutes blocks full of the most loved music.
30 minutes break in between with raffle and disco. Light finger buffet, and more disco at the end.

Great event, almost 100 people, amazing ruffle prizes, and of course a lot of joy from the amazing performance!

We have fundraised overall Â£2485. Many thanks to everyone who participated!
