Our old friends from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/SwanseaUkuleleClub" target="_blank">Swansea Ukulele Club</a>  have once again supported us with a generous donation of Â£800 to fund activities for Ukrainian children!

It was a great pleasure to attend the club's meeting today, listen to the songs, sing together, and discuss our future events, which are now possible thanks to their support. 
Thank you, our dear friends!
