Incredible fundraising for Ukraine

<!--more-->

We are deeply grateful to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/anastasia.opalatenko/" target="_blank">Anastasiia Opalatenko</a> for her incredible fundraising efforts.

She ran a full marathon and raised an amazing **£840** for Sunflowers Wales, all to help buy medical supplies for Ukrainian paramedics! 

Our gratitude extends equally to Corporate Action Company, who generously matched her fundraising, doubling the impact!!!

From the bottom of our hearts, thank you both so very much!

Thanks to your kindness and dedication, we have already purchased items for our next shipment, going out this Saturday.

Sunflowers Wales – Standing Strong Together!
