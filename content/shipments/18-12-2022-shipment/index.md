We will not stop, we continue to help Ukrainians! Our effective work is impossible without you, your help, and your generosity! 

Every hemostatic dressing from our <a href="https://amzn.to/3DeSWrn" target="_blank">Amazon list</a> we sent may save a life. 
Every generator we sent will help Ukrainian medics to continue saving lives. 

It's worth all the effort!

Thank you, our dear friends!

Together we are strong!

Glory to Ukraine!

Glory to the heroes!
