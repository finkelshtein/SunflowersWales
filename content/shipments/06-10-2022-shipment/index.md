Yet another big shipment to Ukraine!

<!--more-->


More than 3 m<sup>3</sup> of humanitarian aid, medical supplies, and a vast number of sleeping bags and winter baselayers!

Many thanks to <a href="https://www.mountainwarehouse.com/" target = "_blank"> Mountain Warehouse</a> for their generous 40% reduction for the goods bought for Ukraine! And of course for the prompt delivery together with <a href="https://www.evri.com/" target = "_blank">EVRi</a>! (The courier does remember our house now:  about 20 large boxes and bags!)

We send shipments to Ukraine every 2 weeks, and they quickly reach our trusted volunteers who send them to the frontline, shelters, orphan house etc! 

Our effective work is impossible without you, your help, your generosity! 
Together we are strong! Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!
