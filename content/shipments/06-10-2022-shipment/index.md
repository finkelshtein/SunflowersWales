Yet another big shipment to Ukraine!

<!--more-->


More than 3 m<sup>3</sup> of humanitarian aid, medical supplies, and a vast number of sleeping bags and winter baselayers!

Many thanks to <a href="https://www.mountainwarehouse.com/" target = "_blank"> Mountain Warehouse</a> for their generous 40% reduction for the goods bought for Ukraine! And of course for the prompt delivery together with <a href="https://www.evri.com/" target = "_blank">EVRi</a>! (The courier does remember our house now:  about 20 large boxes and bags!)

We send shipments to Ukraine every 2 weeks, and they quickly reach our trusted volunteers who send them to the frontline, shelters, orphan house etc! (See FB-posts:
