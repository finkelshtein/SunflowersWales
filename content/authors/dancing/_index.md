Sunflowers dancing group began as a therapeutic outlet for refugee women coping with the trauma of displacement. 

Most of these women are in Wales with their children, representing different regions of Ukraine. They come from diverse backgrounds, including teachers, managers, IT specialists, a translator from Arabic, an accountant, an entrepreneur, a lawyer, and others. 

Most of them never danced professionally back in Ukraine. What started as a small, supportive circle has blossomed into a vibrant group that now meets weekly. Their journey demonstrates that nothing is impossible, as they have progressed from beginners to being invited to perform at various events across the UK, spreading the beauty of Ukrainian culture and the strength of the human spirit wherever they go.
