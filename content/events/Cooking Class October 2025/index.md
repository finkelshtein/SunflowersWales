There are a few things you could watch (and do) forever — and watching reels from Sunflowers Wales or cooking Ukrainian dumplings (varenyky) are definitely among them! 😄

Today, we had our traditional cooking class with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/oksana.chrinowsky/" target="_blank">Oksana Harries</a> at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SkettyParkCommunityCentre/" target="_blank">Sketty Park Community Centre</a>.

It was a great team effort — from setting up tables and equipment to making dough, cooking, and cleaning!

The children had lots of fun too — dancing, singing, and playing on the playground after each stage of their hard work making varenyky (and eating them!).

We are very grateful to everyone involved; it was so nice to gather together today!
