Another wonderful family forest session for Ukrainians at Singleton Park.

A huge thank you to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ForestSchoolSNPT/" target="_blank">Forest School Swansea Neath & Port Talbot</a> for providing such a wonderful and memorable session for our children. We are truly grateful for the warmth, care, and creativity that went into every activity.

The children had the best time — from preparing pizzas completely from scratch, to building their own shelter, chopping wood. Every moment was filled with excitement, teamwork, and joy.

We appreciate all the effort that goes into creating such meaningful outdoor experiences. Thank you for giving our children a day to remember!
