WWT Llanelli Wetland Centre is a vast place full of joy, nature, new experiences, peace, and energy! Birds, paths, canoes â€“ everything was just incredible!

Many thanks to the Centre team for accommodating us so efficiently!
We are also truly grateful to Neath Port Talbot Council for the financial support that made this amazing day possible.
And, as always, many thanks to Neil Keogh for arranging the transport logistics!

Until next time, friends!
