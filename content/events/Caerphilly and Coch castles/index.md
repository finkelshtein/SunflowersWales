55 Ukrainians had a fantastic opportunity to visit Caerphilly and Coch Castles — two in one trip!

There were lots of positive emotions, happy children, new experiences, a touch of Welsh history, and many friends around — it was truly a great day!

Many thanks to Neath Port Talbot Council for the financial support, and to Neil Keogh for such valuable help with logistics!
