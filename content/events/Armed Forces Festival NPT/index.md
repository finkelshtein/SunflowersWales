An amazing day in the warm atmosphere of the Armed Forces Festival in Port Talbot.

We were honoured to be invited to perform there surrounded by friends and presenting Ukrainian culture to the Welsh community. 

Many thanks to everyone involved! 

We are very grateful to the people of Neath Port Talbot for the continuous support!
