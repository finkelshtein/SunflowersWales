It was a great day filled with laughter, fun, chat, swimming in a pool, sitting in jacuzzi and sweating in sauna! üòÄ

Followed by delicious  traditional Xmas dinner that was tasted for the first time!
And Santa visit of course!

All this was a gift to Ukrainian families, members of Sunflowers Wales, who live in an area, from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/601579067497655/user/100064940790482/" target="_blank">Llandeilo Rotary Club!</a>

Day that all of us will remember with smile and gratitude!

Thank you!

Diolch!
