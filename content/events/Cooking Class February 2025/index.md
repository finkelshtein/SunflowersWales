Cooking classes from Sunflowers Wales have become our tradition!

<!--more-->

Almost three hours of positive atmosphere, communication, and activities, and with so tasty results! ðŸ™‚

Many thanks to our amazing volunteers for the perfect organisation and coaching, as well as to all the participants, our children are incredible!

We were proudly supported by <a href="https://www.swansea.gov.uk/" target="_blank">Swansea Council</a> through the Winter Wellbeing Grant! Many thanks to Sketty Park Community Centre for kind hospitality!
