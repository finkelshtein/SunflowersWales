Ukrainian children and their parents from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/601579067497655" target="_blank">Sunflowers Wales (–°–æ–Ω—è—à–Ω–∏–∫–∏)</a>  had an amazing day at the Sketty Park Community Centre celebrating our Easter! 

The day was full of positive emotions, child smiles and memorable impressions! Happy children and happy parents! üôÇ

We had fun with the bouncy castle, games, quizzes, music, traditional Easter food, and of course with the conversations. 

We are a community, and we are strong together!

Glory to Ukraine!
