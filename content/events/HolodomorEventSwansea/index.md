Many thanks to everyone who came along to the memorial evening at Swansea Multicultural Hub for the 90th anniversary of the Holodomor.

We commemorated the millions of killed during that terrible time and those who are killed every day nowadays.

ruZZia tries to take from us bread, water, energy, but they will never destroy our memory!

Glory to Ukraine! Glory to the heroes!

Together we are strong!
