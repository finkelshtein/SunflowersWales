Today is International Children’s day. We held Vigil in Swansea today to commemorate 243 killed and 446 injured Ukrainian children. 

War did not stop. Killings did not stop. Devastation did not stop.

More Ukrainian  civilians have been killed by ruZZian army then soldiers in this war. Innocent children included.

But Children all over the world are born to live, lough, thrive, have fun!

Without children there is no future!

Let’s hope Ukraine  and world has got future!
