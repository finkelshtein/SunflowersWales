💦 It’s always a challenge to run two children’s events in one day!

<!--more-->

In the afternoon, we had our traditional — yet always new — swimming party at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PenlanLC" target="_blank">Penlan Leisure Centre</a>. It’s just one hour, but an hour full of laughter, children’s energy, and positive emotions! 🏊‍♀️💙

We truly love these events and are already planning to repeat them in the future.

Many thanks to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/swanseacitycouncil" target="_blank">Swansea City Council</a> for their financial support through the COAST grant. 🙏
