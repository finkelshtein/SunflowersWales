# Community Group

<br>

Welcome to the website of **Sunflowers Wales**, a nonprofit Community Group organized by Ukrainian volunteers in Wales to support Ukrainians affected by Russiaâ€™s invasion.

We are a group of friends who actively worked from 2014; in particular, we organised regular shipments of humanitarian aid and medical supplies to Ukraine.

Starting from April 2022, another our big activity is the help to Ukrainian refugees.
We are aimed to unite Ukrainians arrived in Wales, help them to settle to the Welsh community keeping the contact with their own. 

You can find on this site info <a href="/about/">about us</a> and our <a href="/news/">recent shipments and fundraising activities</a>, about <a href="/events/">recent events</a> we organised or participated, about our <a href="/contact/">contacts</a>, and various <a href="/donate/">ways to support</a> Ukrainians suffering from the barbaric aggression.
